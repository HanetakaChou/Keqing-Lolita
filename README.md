The number of textures was more than **40**! These textures have been [baked](https://github.com/HanetakaChou/glTF-UV-Baking) into one single texture!  

The vertex count of "necklace" mesh subset was more than **100k**! The vertex count of the whole mesh was more than **300k**! These vertices of each mesh subset have been merged by **weld** and **decimate** modifier! The vertex count of the whole mesh has been reduced to **50k**!  

The materials were **double-sided**. The skirt was NOT able to be rendered correctly when **backface-culling** was enabled! Missing vertices have been added to enable **backface-culling**!
